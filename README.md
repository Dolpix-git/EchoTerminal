I've seen these tools around and I'm surprised there wasn't a free alternative. So I took a weekend and built this lib! It’s a clean, modular way to trigger logic in Unity—at runtime or in the editor—without the usual price tag or bloat. I kept it slim and well-structured so you can actually see what’s going on under the hood. The UI is totally flexible, so you can tweak it until it fits your project, or just gut the whole thing and use the backend logic. Im hoping this makes your game dev journy easier, so grab it, rip it up, and spread the word. 
Also, if you find it usefull, And you can aford it. Buying me a coffee would be sick!
Open to any questions, issues, or recomendations you have!
